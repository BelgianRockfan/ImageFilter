ImageFilter
===========

Filters images with any given dimensions out of any given directory and copies them to another directory.

Steps to make this work:   
1) Download the .zip file and extract it.  
OR  
1) Go to https://github.com/BelgianRockfan/ImageFilter/releases if you only want the .exe  
  
2) Run ImageFilter.exe. If you get a message from your antivirus software saying it's scanning the file, let it run its course, it shouldn't take long.  
3) Add the directory with the images you want to filter to Input folder.
4) Add the directory where you want the images with your selected dimensions to go.  
5) Add any number of dimensions by clicking the Add Dimension button. Enter your dimension in the box that pops up (e.g. 1920x1080).  
If you want to remove a dimension from the list, simply click the Remove Dimension button and enter the dimensions.  
6) Click filter.  

Notes:   
You can't select two dimensions with the same X-value (e.g. 1920x1080 and 1920x1200).  
The content of the input folder will remain the same after filtering.
